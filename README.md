## Overview from Application to Hardware
-   **Apps**: Application software, often referred to as "apps," performs specific tasks or functions for end-users.
    
-   **System Software**: This category acts as an intermediary between hardware components and user-facing applications. It provides essential services, manages resources, and enables application execution.
    
-   **Operating System**: The fundamental software managing hardware resources and offering services for users and applications. It controls memory, processes, files, and interfaces (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, Android).
    
-   **Compiler**: Translates high-level programming code( C ,C++ , java etc... ) into assembly-level language.
    
-   **Assembler**: Converts assembly language code into machine code ( 10101011100 ) for direct processor execution.
    
-   **RTL (Register Transfer Level)**: Represents digital circuit behavior using registers and data transfer operations.
    
-   **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer system or electronic device enabling various tasks.
